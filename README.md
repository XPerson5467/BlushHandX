## DISCLAIMER

This game includes content not safe for work content, those under 18 should turn back now.
All characters depicted are 18 or older.

Characters, art, and original game was created by NitroMagnetic.
I only recreated it to work with the godot engine.
Right now I’m re-releasing this game for the sake of preservation but if Nitro doesn’t want the game up I will comply.
For now this is an open source project so go wild!
